Hello! I'm a Software Engineer working at Siemens Digital Industries Software, working hard to improve my craft.

In my free time, I'm also an Indie Video Game Developer. My LLC, Dualikiwi Games, published <a href="/2025/02/24/dualikiwiSteamRelease.html" target="_blank">its first game</a> on Steam in 2025!

I'm also the current leader of IGDA Cincinnati, my local branch of the International Game Developer Association. In that role, I organize monthly meetings to discuss Game Development and network with local peers.

## Working With Me
When I contribute to a project or software feature, I put everything I can into it! I'm confident that I can create any software asked of me; only question is how long it will take üòâ

Speaking of which, I never hesitate to ask questions. When I do ask, I like to get straight to the point; I'm a quick learner, and once I understand a solution, I'm excited to go implement it!

## Interests

I am a gamer, programmer, and cat dad! Some of my hobbies include attending board game nights, visiting breweries, <a href="/AllProjects/">creating Game Jam games,</a> and traveling to conventions!

Raised by a family of musicians, I'm also a big music fan! I love going to concerts, recently took up Vinyl collecting, and have teaching myself to play Guitar since 2020!
