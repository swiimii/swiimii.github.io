A Bagel and Scream Cheese is a small Unity game that I made in 12 hours at the 2019 MakeUC Hackathon, alongside one artist. It was created to be played on both WebGL and Android.

Features:
- Bagel Embodiment Gameplay
- Horde Survival Gameplay

Major Contributions:
- 100% Codebase

Lessons Learned:
- Building for Android with Unity
- Minimal-Scope Game Design
- Static Variables (major lesson learned)
