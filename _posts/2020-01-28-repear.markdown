Re:Pear is a Unity2D game made during the Global Game Jam 2020, at the University of Cincinnati. I made code for various parts of the project. I was joined by 5 collaborators, whom I assembled before the event. You play as Paddington Pear, part of a pair of Pears whose marriage is in peril, as he tries to repair his broken marriage. This game was made in 48 hours, under the jam's theme of "Repair".
