Dualikiwi is a game created for the 2022 Global Game Jam, which I made alongside two colleagues. I wrote all of the code for the game, and led its production. I consider Dualikiwi to be one of my best-polished hackathon/jam projects. I have been further developing Dualikiwi, alongside the game's other creators, and plan to release the game in the future.

Features:
- Puzzle Gameplay
- High Production Value

Major Contributions:
- 100% Codebase
- Production

Lessons Learned:
- Template Method Pattern
- Saving Progress w/ PlayerPrefs
