Shell Sweet Shell is a Unity2D game made during the Global Game Jam 2018, at the University of Cincinnati. I made code for various parts of the project. I was joined by 6 collaborators, most of whom I had gathered before the event. The player's objective is to get past obstacles, and find a new home. WARNING: Due to time constraints, there are many parts of this game which don't function perfectly.
