Originally created for the 2022 Global Game Jam, Dualikiwi is a Sokoban game where you, a mere kiwi bird, must defeat a horde of evil clones. I created Dualikiwi alongside 2 other contributors. Dualikiwi will be available on Steam in Q1 2025.

- Level editor
- Steam Achievements

Major Contributions:
- 100% Code / Unity Contribution
