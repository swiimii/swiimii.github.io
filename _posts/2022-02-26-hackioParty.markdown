Hack-io Party is a project I made in 24 hours with 3 colleagues for RevolutionUC 2022, the last hackathon I attended while in college! I produced this project while teaching 2 fellow students to use Unity. It is a short series of mini-games, which are designed to be played with a custom controller we made from scratch. This project was awarded "2nd Place Overall" and "Best Hardware Hack", when pitted against 30 other submissions!

Features:
- Minigame Rush Gameplay
- Custom Breadboard Controller

Major Contributions:
- Some Code Contributions
- Unity Knowledge Sharing
- Arduino & C Knowledge Sharing

Lessons Learned:
- Hackathons like it when you learn something new
