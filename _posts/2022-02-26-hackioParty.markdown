Hack-io Party is a project I made in 24 hours with 3 colleagues for RevolutionUC 2022, the last hackathon I attended while in college! It is a short series of mini-games, which are designed to be played with a custom controller we made from scratch. This project was awarded "2nd Place Overall" and "Best Hardware Hack", when pitted against 30 other submissions!
