"Good Soup" is a 2D Point-and-Click game, in which you play as a chef attempting to poison a king.

Created in 48 hours for the 2026 Global Game Jam alongside 3 other participants. I was the artist and audio lead for this project.

Features:
- 2D Point & Click Puzzle
- Good Soup
- Mostly Sam-made art

Major Contributions:
- ~70% Art. I created all art assets except the character, and blurry castle background.
- Looping ~90-second music track

Lessons Learned:
- Cakewalk Next w/ Midi Keyboard
- Procreate + Google Drive art pipeline
