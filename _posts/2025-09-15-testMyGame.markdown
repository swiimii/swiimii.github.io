"Test My Game" is a narrative-driven 2D platformer where you play as a game tester finding bugs in a game, accompanied by two wacky game-makers.

Created in 48 hours for the Patch Notes 1.0 Game Jam alongside 3 other contributors, two artists and 1 programmer.

Features:
- 2D Platforming
- 3D Platforming
- Fully Voice-Acted
- Multiple (2) endings

Major Contributions:
- 100% Script, though some was performed & workshopped by the VA for "Dev"
- Re-usable code for Levels
- "Josh" Voice Acting

Lessons Learned:
- Game Jam Management
- Subtitling Tools ("Subtitle Edit")
