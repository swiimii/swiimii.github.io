Created in ~4 days on a whim, inspired by Samperson's Cat Cursor application and Insaniquarium Deluxe.

Features:
- Collect fish which swim on top of your Windows UI and other applications.
- Fish can be made transparent to reduce fishs' obstruction of other apps.

Major Contributions:
- 60% of Fish art, per version 1.1.0.
- 100% of the rest of the project.

Lessons Learned:
- Windows API Calls from within Unity.
  - With the strategy I used, UI elements don't work if you want to have the ability to click through to other applications.
- Video Recording Learning.
  - DaVinci Resolve > Vegas Pro 14
  - Record lots of good footage at once, then edit it down.
- Marketing
  - Creating a good trailer is extremely important.
  - Itch.io supports gifs for project thumbnails. Use them!
