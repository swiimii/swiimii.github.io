Star-Cursed Lovers is a fully voice-acted dating sim, in which you play Dialogue Cards to woo potential suitors and free yourself from a curse. I created this game for the 2024 Global Game Jam, acting as a programmer & producer alongside ~8 other contributors.

Features:
- Dating sim gameplay
- 3 Different card decks, with unique dialogue options.
- Fully voice-acted love interests
- 8 Different Endings

Major Contributions:
- Production Lead
- Card Play & Data System
- Suitor Selector System
- Voice Acting for Spike (alongside 1 contributor (we spoke at the same time and it was funny))

Lessons Learned:
- Voice Acting Logistics
- Dialogue-Focused Production
- Producing a high-contributor-count project can be difficult with inexperienced contributors.
- UI Scaling in Unity can be *terrible* without TextMeshPro
