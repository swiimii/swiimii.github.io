Magical Birds is a game made for my Software Engineering course during my Summer 2019 semester. I worked with three group members over 3 months, while also under a 16-hour courseload, to create this game with 4 levels. My tasks primarily included creating the Player & enemies (including the boss cat on level 4), as well as creating the first and third levels. The game was designed to be playable on both web and desktop, and has partial controller support.

I'd personally recommend playing levels 1 and 4 since those were the levels I designed!
