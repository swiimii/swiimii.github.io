The Final (Music) Stand is a platform fighter in which players brawl for the opportunity to perform a solo! The first player to earn enough points during their performances wins!

I co-produced and wrote code for this game during an 11-day game jam, working primarily on weekends, alongside 4 other contributors.

Features:
- Platform Fighter Gameplay
- Rythm Gameplay
- Online Multiplayer

Major Contributions:
- Rythm Minigame
- Production
- Partial Character Controller Contribution

Lessons Learned:
- Long-term Jam Logistics & Planning
- Netcode for Gameobjects
- Timing-Sensitive Gameplay (Synching Rythm Game Properly)
