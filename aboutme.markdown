Hi, I am Sam Scherer! I'm currently a Software Engineer at Siemens Digital Industries Software, working hard to improve my craft.

In my free time, I'm also an Indie Video Game Developer. I recently created an LLC, Dualikiwi Games, with the intention of publishing my first game on Steam!

## Working With Me
When I contribute to a project or software feature, I put everything I can into it! I'm confident that I can create any software asked of me; only question is how long it will take ðŸ˜‰

Speaking of which, I never hesitate to ask questions. When I do ask, I like to get straight to the point; I'm a quick learner, and once I understand a solution, I'm excited to go implement it!

## Interests

I am a gamer, programmer, and cat dad! Some of my hobbies include attending board game nights, visiting breweries, <a href="/AllProjects/">creating Game Jam games,</a> and attending various conventions!

Raised by a family of musicians, I'm also a big music fan! I love going to concerts, recently took up Vinyl collecting, and have teaching myself to play Guitar since 2020!
